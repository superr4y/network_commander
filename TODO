- updating the index (set_index) messes the entire code up
  find a better way of doing it
- config folder with example networks
- only XCommander should access exe and env
- commander.py configure => change to normal user
- TorOnionRouter/Proxy/HiddenService/Bridge/Base-Commander
- LxcCommander only supports one child, add multi child functionality
- GUI: layout, update button to get an overview what is running
- GUI: kill/start single lxc (context menu)
- I used some static path and username in the code, should fix that
